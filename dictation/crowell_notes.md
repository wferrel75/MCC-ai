 It's a temporary fix took the 2008 R 2 domain controller and DNS server offline by disconnecting the blue networking cable from port 24 on the HP broker switch and plugging in in Windows 7 box it's running a docker desktop container for bind to provide simple DNS relaying I'm sorry that's port 23 in the HP switch all of the devices that are unable to connect to anything are currently being locked out by Sentinel one isolating the devices due to our attempted deploying the datto RMM agent.

 The temporary box is a ace magician the tiny little computer sitting on the rack underneath the Great Plains ubiquity switch I disconnected a white thing that came we're going into port 23 on the the HP switch that the server was originally connected to also removed an older HP switch they're sitting on the floor next to the servers on the bottom of the middle shelf thing they've got in here as well as what appears to be an older ethernet router device that is no longer in use buses devices we're powered on but had no connections to them so

## Windows 11 Pro Upgrade Options

### Nonprofit Pricing for Windows 11 Pro

| Option | Price | Quantity Limit | Details |
|--------|-------|----------------|---------|
| **Windows 11 Pro (Full License)** | **$16/license** | Up to 50 licenses per 2-year cycle | Through TechSoup |
| **Windows 11 Pro (Commercial)** | $199/license | Unlimited | Retail pricing |
| **Nonprofit Discount** | **92% savings** | | $16 vs. $199 |

### How to Upgrade Windows 11 Home to Pro

#### Option 1: TechSoup Donated Licenses (Recommended)

**Process:**
1. Apply for TechSoup nonprofit validation (if not already validated)
2. Request Windows 11 Pro licenses through TechSoup
3. Receive product keys via email
4. Use product keys to upgrade Windows 11 Home to Pro

**Key Details:**
- **Cost:** $16 per license (administrative fee)
- **Quantity:** Up to 50 licenses every 2 years
- **Includes:** Downgrade rights to Windows 10 Pro
- **License Type:** Full license (NOT an upgrade-only license)
- **Can be used for:** Fresh installs OR upgrading from Home to Pro

**Upgrade Process:**
1. On Windows 11 Home device, go to **Settings > System > Activation**
2. Click **Change product key**
3. Enter the Windows 11 Pro product key from TechSoup
4. Windows will automatically upgrade from Home to Pro
5. Device will reboot and activate as Windows 11 Pro

**Important:** Microsoft provides **full Windows 11 Pro licenses** (not separate upgrade licenses) to nonprofits. A full Pro license can be used to upgrade a Home edition device.

#### Option 2: Microsoft 365 Business Premium Upgrade Rights

If you license users with **Microsoft 365 Business Premium**, they receive **Windows 11 Pro upgrade rights** as part of their subscription.

**How it works:**
- User must be assigned a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license
- Device must be running Windows 11 Home (or Windows 10 Home)
- Device must be Azure AD-joined or Hybrid Azure AD-joined
- Upgrade to Pro happens automatically via subscription activation

**Cost:** Included with Microsoft 365 Business Premium (~$5.50/user/month nonprofit)

**Benefit:** No need to purchase separate Windows licenses if you're already using Business Premium.

#### Option 3: Volume Licensing (Advanced)

Some nonprofits have reported success using **Microsoft Volume Licensing** to obtain Pro upgrade licenses, but this requires:
- Existing nonprofit volume license agreement with Microsoft
- Contacting Microsoft support for assistance
- May not be available in all regions

**Note:** There are conflicting reports about whether volume licensing can be used for Home to Pro upgrades. Some nonprofits report being quoted £275 (~$350 USD) for upgrades, while others have received free volume licenses with Microsoft support's help.

### Crowell Memorial Home Specific Recommendation

**For Crowell:**
1. **Immediate:** Request 50 Windows 11 Pro licenses from TechSoup at $16 each = **$800 total**
2. **Ongoing:** Use Microsoft 365 Business Premium upgrade rights for any future devices

**Estimated Savings:** $199/license × 68 computers = $13,532 commercial price vs. $800 nonprofit price = **$12,732 savings**

## Important 2025 License Changes

### July 1, 2025: End of FREE Business Premium & E1 Grants

**What's Changing:**

On **July 1, 2025**, Microsoft will discontinue offering **FREE donated licenses** for:
- ❌ Microsoft 365 Business Premium
- ❌ Office 365 E1

**What's Staying:**

✅ **Microsoft 365 Business Basic** - Remains FREE (up to 300 users)

✅ **Discounted pricing** (60-75% off) continues for:
- Microsoft 365 Business Premium (~$5.50/user/month instead of free)
- Office 365 E1 (~$2/user/month instead of free)
- All other nonprofit plans

**Impact on Existing Customers:**

- Organizations currently using **FREE Business Premium or E1 grants** can continue until their **next renewal date**
- Upon renewal **on or after July 1, 2025**, they must transition to:
  - **Option 1:** Paid (but discounted 75%) Business Premium or E1
  - **Option 2:** Downgrade to FREE Business Basic (lose desktop Office apps, MFA, Intune)
  - **Option 3:** Switch to alternative plans

**Timeline for Crowell Memorial Home:**

Since Crowell is **starting fresh** (not currently using Microsoft 365 grants), this change has **minimal impact**. However, it's important to understand:

- You will **NOT** receive FREE Business Premium grants (that ship has sailed as of May 2025)
- You **WILL** receive **discounted pricing** (75% off) for Business Premium: ~$5.50/user/month
- You **CAN** use FREE Business Basic for users who don't need desktop Office apps or advanced security

### April 1, 2025: Billing Model Changes

Starting **April 1, 2025**, Microsoft is changing billing options:

- **Annual Prepaid** (default) - Pay for full year upfront (best value)
- **Annual with Monthly Billing** - Pay monthly but commit to annual contract (+5% premium)
- **Monthly Billing** - Pay monthly with no commitment (+20% premium)

**Recommendation:** Choose **Annual Prepaid** to avoid premium charges and lock in lowest pricing.

### July 1, 2026: Commercial Price Increases

Microsoft announced that **commercial pricing will increase on July 1, 2026**. Nonprofit pricing will increase proportionally since it's tied to commercial pricing through fixed discount percentages (60-75%).

**Impact:** Nonprofit pricing will rise, but the **discount percentage remains the same** (60-75% off commercial).

## Current Licensing Status at Crowell Memorial Home

### Existing Microsoft 365 Licenses (As of November 2025)

**IMPORTANT FINDING:** Crowell Memorial Home **already has an active Microsoft 365 nonprofit tenant** with the following licenses:

#### Current License Allocation

| Product | Quantity | Monthly Cost | Status | Invoice |
|---------|----------|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Microsoft 365 Business Premium (Nonprofit Staff Pricing)** | **10** | **$0.00 (FREE)** | **DONATED** | E0700Y4IH2 |

**License Details:**
- **Order Number:** d961c2a7-b6e1-4294-aa18-0d4f520250d4
- **Billing Period:** 10/08/2025 - 11/07/2025
- **Invoice Date:** November 8, 2025
- **Billing Status:** Monthly subscription, auto-payment (no charge)
- **Service Period:** 10/10/2025 - 11/09/2025

### What This Means for Migration

#### ✅ Positive Implications

1. **Nonprofit Status Already Validated:** Microsoft has already approved Crowell as a qualifying nonprofit
2. **Grandfathered FREE Licenses:** Currently receiving 10 FREE Business Premium licenses (after July 1, 2025 cutoff)
3. **Existing Tenant:** No need to create a new tenant - can expand existing one
4. **Includes Premium Features:** Each license includes:
   - Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams
   - **Entra ID Premium P1** (MFA, Conditional Access)
   - **Microsoft Intune** (device management)
   - Windows 11 Pro upgrade rights
   - Defender for Office 365 Plan 1

#### 🔍 Critical Questions to Investigate

1. **Will the 10 FREE licenses remain free during/after migration?**
   - Need to verify with Microsoft support
   - May be grandfathered into donation program
   - Could result in additional $660/year savings if retained

2. **Can we add 49 additional licenses at nonprofit pricing?**
   - Need 59 total (currently have 10)
   - Additional 49 licenses at $5.50/month = $269.50/month
   - Total cost: $3,234/year (vs. $3,894/year if all paid)

3. **Is the current tenant properly configured?**
   - Domain verification status
   - Security baseline configuration
   - Existing user assignments

4. **Are there any other licenses or subscriptions not shown on this invoice?**
   - Check for Azure AD Premium standalone subscriptions
   - Check for other Microsoft products (Project, Visio, etc.)

### Revised Cost Scenarios

#### Scenario A: FREE Licenses Retained (BEST CASE)
```
10 licenses: $0.00/month (FREE - grandfathered donation)
49 licenses: $269.50/month ($5.50 × 49)
─────────────────────────────────
Monthly Total: $269.50
Annual Total: $3,234/year
```

**Savings vs. All Paid Nonprofit:**
- $3,894 - $3,234 = **$660/year additional savings**

**5-Year Total:** $16,170 (vs. $19,470 if all paid)

#### Scenario B: All Licenses Paid at Nonprofit Rate
```
59 licenses: $324.50/month ($5.50 × 59)
─────────────────────────────────
Monthly Total: $324.50
Annual Total: $3,894/year
```

**5-Year Total:** $19,470

#### Scenario C: Lose Nonprofit Status (WORST CASE - Unlikely)
```
59 licenses: $1,298/month ($22 × 59)
─────────────────────────────────
Monthly Total: $1,298.00
Annual Total: $15,576/year
```

### Action Items for Licensing Investigation

During Phase 1 (Assessment & Planning), the project team should:

- [ ] **Contact Microsoft support** to verify donation status and grandfathering
  - Call: 1-800-865-9408
  - Portal: https://aka.ms/Office365Billing
  - Question: "Can our 10 donated licenses remain free when we add 49 more?"

- [ ] **Review Microsoft 365 Admin Center** for:
  - [ ] Current license assignments (who has the 10 licenses?)
  - [ ] Domain verification status
  - [ ] Security defaults / Conditional Access policies
  - [ ] Any other subscriptions or trials

- [ ] **Document current tenant configuration:**
  - [ ] Tenant ID
  - [ ] Primary domain
  - [ ] Admin accounts
  - [ ] MFA enrollment status

- [ ] **Verify nonprofit validation status:**
  - [ ] Check if validated through TechSoup
  - [ ] Confirm 501(c)(3) documentation on file
  - [ ] Verify grant renewal date (if applicable)

- [ ] **Get written confirmation from Microsoft:**
  - [ ] Email confirmation of donation status
  - [ ] Pricing quote for additional 49 licenses
  - [ ] Confirmation that adding licenses won't affect existing free ones

## Recommendations for Crowell Memorial Home

### Recommended Licensing Strategy

Based on Crowell's environment (47 employees, 50-55 total licenses estimated, 68 computers, HIPAA requirements) and **existing 10 FREE licenses**, here's our recommendation:

#### Option 1: Expand Existing Microsoft 365 Business Premium Tenant (RECOMMENDED)

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Already have 10 FREE Business Premium licenses (donated)
- ✅ Nonprofit status validated
- ✅ Tenant already configured

**Additional Licenses Needed:** 40-45 user licenses (to reach 50-55 total)
- **Employee Count:** 47 active employees (verified from employee list 2025-12-12)
- **Service/Shared Accounts:** 3-8 estimated
- **Conservative Estimate:** 55 total licenses

**Monthly Cost:**
- **Best Case (FREE licenses retained):**
  - 10 licenses: $0.00/month (FREE - donation)
  - 45 licenses: $247.50/month ($5.50 × 45)
  - **Monthly Total: $247.50/month**
  - **Annual: $2,970/year**

- **Standard Case (all 55 licenses paid):**
  - 55 licenses: $302.50/month ($5.50 × 55)
  - **Monthly Total: $302.50/month**
  - **Annual: $3,630/year**

- **If 59 Licenses Needed (Original Estimate):**
  - 59 licenses: $324.50/month
  - **Annual: $3,894/year**

**What's Included:**
- ✅ Desktop Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook)
- ✅ Exchange Online email (50 GB mailbox)
- ✅ OneDrive for Business (1 TB per user)
- ✅ SharePoint Online (file sharing and collaboration)
- ✅ Microsoft Teams (chat, meetings, calling)
- ✅ **Entra ID Premium P1** (MFA, Conditional Access) - **HIPAA REQUIRED**
- ✅ **Microsoft Intune** (device management) - **HIPAA REQUIRED**
- ✅ Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 (email security)
- ✅ Information Protection (DLP)
- ✅ **Windows 11 Pro upgrade rights** (included in subscription)

**Why This is Best for Crowell:**
1. **HIPAA Compliance:** Includes MFA and Intune for device management
2. **Cost-Effective:** All-in-one bundle at 75% discount
3. **No Separate Windows Licenses Needed:** Pro upgrade rights included
4. **Desktop Office Apps:** Full productivity suite for staff
5. **Modern Security:** Advanced threat protection and data loss prevention

#### Option 2: Business Basic + Entra ID P1 (Budget Option)

**Licenses Needed:**
- 59 × Microsoft 365 Business Basic = **FREE**
- 59 × Entra ID Premium P1 = 59 × $1.50/month = **$88.50/month**

**Monthly Cost:** $88.50/month | **Annual:** $1,062/year

**What's Included:**
- Exchange Online, OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams (web apps only)
- ✅ **Entra ID Premium P1** (MFA, Conditional Access)
- ❌ **NO desktop Office apps** (web-based only)
- ❌ **NO Intune** (no device management)
- ❌ **NO Windows 11 Pro upgrade rights**

**Gaps:**
- Must purchase **Windows 11 Pro licenses separately** ($16 × 68 = $1,088 one-time via TechSoup)
- No device management (Intune) - harder to maintain HIPAA compliance
- No desktop Office apps - users must use web versions

**Why We Don't Recommend This:**
- Saves money upfront but lacks critical HIPAA features (Intune)
- No Windows 11 Pro upgrade rights (must purchase separately)
- Limited functionality for staff

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Tiered Licensing)

**Licenses:**
- **30 × Business Premium** (administrative, management, billing staff) = $165/month
- **29 × Business Basic** (nursing staff who only need email and EHR) = FREE

**Monthly Cost:** $165/month | **Annual:** $1,980/year

**Pros:**
- Cost savings for users who don't need desktop Office apps
- All users still get MFA and security (if you add Entra ID P1 to Basic users)

**Cons:**
- More complex to manage (two license types)
- Nursing staff may need desktop apps for documentation
- Still need Windows 11 Pro licenses for devices

### Windows 11 Pro Licensing

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Immediate:** Request **50 Windows 11 Pro licenses** from TechSoup
   - Cost: $16 × 50 = **$800**
   - Covers 50 of 68 devices

2. **After 2 Years:** Request **18 more licenses** in next cycle
   - Cost: $16 × 18 = **$288**
   - Covers remaining 18 devices

3. **Alternative:** If licensing all users with Microsoft 365 Business Premium, use **subscription-based Pro upgrade rights** (no additional cost)

**Total Windows Cost:** $800 initially + $288 in 2 years = **$1,088 total** vs. $13,532 commercial

### Total Cost Summary (Recommended: Business Premium + Windows) - REVISED

**Updated Based on Employee Count (47 employees + 8 service accounts = 55 total licenses)**

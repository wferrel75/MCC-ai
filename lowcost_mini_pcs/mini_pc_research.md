## Key Finding: The $250 Budget with Windows 11 Pro Challenge

Finding mini PCs that meet ALL criteria (especially 12GB+ RAM, 250GB+ SSD, AND Windows 11 Pro included) at or below $250 is challenging but possible with current deals.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Windows 11 Pro Verification Required

**BEFORE PURCHASING, ALWAYS VERIFY:**
1. Product listing explicitly states "Windows 11 Pro" (NOT just "Windows 11")
2. Check product images for Windows 11 Pro branding
3. Read recent customer reviews mentioning which Windows version shipped
4. Contact seller to confirm if listing is unclear
5. Understand return policy in case wrong Windows version arrives

**Why This Matters:** A Windows 11 Home to Pro upgrade costs $99, which would push your budget significantly higher. Many budget mini PC listings are inconsistent about specifying Pro vs Home editions.

**Purchase Links Below Have Been Verified** (as of January 2025), but always double-check before ordering as listings can change.

## CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Windows 11 Pro Reality Check
The inclusion of Windows 11 Pro at this price point is what makes these deals compelling. A standalone Windows 11 Pro license costs ~$199, so these systems essentially provide the hardware for $50-$100 when factoring in the OS value.

### Warranty & Support Reality
This is the BIGGEST concern in this price segment:
- **GMKtec:** Poor support reputation, unresponsive to warranty claims
- **Beelink:** Best support of the three, more responsive, honors warranties
- **Acemagic:** Mixed reviews, slow response times

### Performance for Your Use Case
All three options will handle the requirements well:
- Web browsing: Excellent
- Office applications: Very good
- Email: Excellent
- Video conferencing: Good (1080p no problem)
- Multiple Chrome tabs: Good with 12-16GB RAM
- Light multitasking: Good

**These are NOT suitable for:**
- Gaming beyond casual/retro games
- Video editing
- 3D rendering
- Heavy development workloads

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**If budget is absolute constraint:** GMKtec NucBox G5 at $143-179 (accept support risks)

**If you can stretch to $230:** Beelink S12 Pro (best balance of specs, quality, and support)

**If you catch it on sale:** Acemagic V1 at $199-219 (best specs, but verify deal pricing first)

### **Recommended Choice: Beelink Mini S12 Pro**

**Reasoning:**
1. Only slightly above budget (~$230 vs $250)
2. Better support reputation significantly reduces risk
3. Exceeds requirements (16GB RAM, 500GB storage)
4. Better build quality and QC
5. WiFi 6 for future-proofing
6. Expandable storage
7. The extra $50-80 over GMKtec is worth it for peace of mind on warranty support
